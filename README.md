# Help Zelty

We are Zelty, a POS solution that allows restaurateurs to focus on their business: https://www.zelty.fr
When we wanted to create our GitHub account, we were faced with this harsh reality: [@zelty](https://github.com/zelty) is already taken and there's no way to contact its owner.

So if you are [@zelty](https://github.com/zelty) or if you know the guy, please contact us and talk!
